# Flower-classification-modelling-and-prediction
This Project is about sample collection of flower species,which was cleaned and modelled for future prediction.	

This will enable the Agricuture lab in future prediction of flower species,

PROCESSES INVOLVED are: 

1. Data collection and importation 

2. Data cleaning 

3. Data preprocessing(EDA) 

4. Data visualization 

5. Data Modelling 

6. Model Evaluation

7. Data Prediction**
